My solutions to the exercises in the book `Scala for the Impatient`

The book [Scala for the Impatient](http://horstmann.com/scala/) by Cay S. Horstmann is an introduction
to the Scala programming language. Chapters 1 to 11 of the book are available as a free download at
[https://www.lightbend.com/resources/e-book/scala-for-the-impatient](https://www.lightbend.com/resources/e-book/scala-for-the-impatient).

This repo contains my solutions to the exercises in the book.

I used Scala 2.11.8 and the [IntelliJ IDEA, Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) IDE.
