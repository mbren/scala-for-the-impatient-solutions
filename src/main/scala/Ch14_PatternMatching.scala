  //Q5
  // One can use lists to model trees that store values only in the leaves. For example, the list <List(List(3, 8) 2 List(5))> describes the tree.
  // However, some of the list elements are numbers and others are lists. In Scala, you cannot have heterogeneous lists, so you have to use a <List[Any]>.
  // Write a <leafSum> function to compute the sum of all elements in the leaves, using pattern matching to differentiate between numbers and lists.

      }

  // A better way of modeling such trees is with case classes. Let's start with binary trees.
  //Write a function to compute the sum of all elements in the leaves.

  //val h = compose(f, g)

  // the method on the left).  For example, h(0) = f(g(0)) = f(-1) = None
